<p>I have many more images to share but these ones I wanted to share with you all straight away. Some of these images were taken late in the afternoon some with flash. I also wet the work so you can see what it will look like after a rain storm which gives a good contrast between the white granite and the black granite base.  Weather has been sunny with only one day of rain For the last few day the mornings have been cool and by 4 PM the wind has an icy chill about it. Lots of work but lots of fun.</p>

<p>So 3 days work left to finish my sculpture. Polishing, polishing, polishing. I had the stone laid on its side today to make it easier for me to work on. Then of course the sculpture has to be moved onto a black granite base which I have already selected. Big tyers had to be laid on timber logs to cushion the fall as the stone was moved into its new position. A mobile gantry with a very large hook was used to the piece into position. Great to watch the care taken when the artisans move the stone.</p>
<p>Amazing that the work balances so well on such a small surface for such a big and heavy stone; heart in the mouth experience. Base reduced slightly in height so that the sculpture sits more comfortably on the base.</p>

<p>I moved into accommodation at the Art Park so no more early morning bus rides etc. Also l have shower after work before dinner which is great.</p>
<p>My abode for the last week of the Symposium. It is situated at the Art Park which is great; no more early buses to catch ! Also billeted in this strange flower pot house is Nardoo pictured; he is from Iran now living in London and has been assisting me by showing me the right tools to use and the sequence in which to use them; so many tools.</p>
<p>Spending most of my time lately, shaping and polishing my 3 metre sculpture of white granite. Like every polishing job one has to go through all the grades using a angle grinder with both hands. Tiring work but rewarding and I take regular breaks and stretch.</p>

<p>Many sculptures have been completed their work which has been stood- up to be viewed by visitors this afternoon. It proved to be a very emotional time for those leaving for South America, South Africa, Europe land, and so many places with odd sounding names. Two guys from Ghana now call me &#8216;the god father&#8217;; not sure why but they smile when they say it which is great as they are so much bigger than me.</p>
<p>As you can see from the images of my sculpture it is coming on but still more shaping and finishing. Luckily I have a few more days to finish the work! .It is amazing how the artisans at the Stone Factory move such large rocks with such ease; the care they take is admirable. One false move and the sculpture can be seriously damaged.</p>

<p>We explored these places but only after we had lunch at a traditional Korean restaurant where we sat cross legged on the floor eating out of huge bowls where all the food items were mixed together with a variety of sauces for good measure.</p>

<p>Artists were also offered the opportunity to make a presentation of their work. WOW. Every time the artist’s shared their work I realised what a depth there was in the talent and experience that had been assembled for this symposium. Painting, printmaking, drawing, clay modelling, bronze casting, wood and stone carving, monumental /heroic sculpture, sculpture using cast resin, works incorporating rope and bondage techniques.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the way back to the Arts Park we crossed a 37 kilometre road built on top of a dam wall. The dam held back the sea and is part of a project to reclaim land from the sea. Massive flood gates open at low tide to let water flow out to sea and closed to prevent sea water inundating the newly drained land; a massive project indeed. We drove past a wind farm and ship building yards with massive mobile cranes capable of lifting ships under construction. I have a new found respect for those that build and drive cranes that deal with heavy loads.</p>

<p>I arrived a week after the majority of sculptors had commenced work so I was able to see many of the works in progress. Part of the joy of being at a symposium is the opportunity to look and learn from others. It is wonderful to have the opportunity to talk with other Artists and have them comment on your work</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My expensive face mask and safety goggles I laid aside as they proved to be too hot to wear in the warm conditions; my mask became useless as my goggles would steamed up and no matter what I did I could not see clearly. I decided to use the same light weight 3M paper masks and safety glasses in ordinary looking glasses frame as the artisans used and had no more problems. I wore two baseball caps one with the peak turned back to front to protect my neck from the sun.</p>

<p>I also decided to use the gum boots that were supplied instead of my leather steel capped work boots. Luckily nothing heavy fell on my foot and my work boots are still intact. Work clothes I had used in Australia proved to be too hot and fell apart at the zips, which in one way, was a great relief.</p>
<p>Waterproof aprons were supplied and worn by most of the sculptors. On one particularly hot day a guy wore only his underpants and apron which was a sight for the visitors to the Stone Factory on that day.</p>
<p>One day it rained so all the artists were bundled onto a luxury bus, (a coffee dispensing machine at the front of the bus), and taken on a long trip to a famous ancient Buddhist Temple complex. We had a great time and found the buildings and the landscape inspiring in its beauty. (Of course we had to make up for the day lost by working on Sunday).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Work at the Stone Factory commenced at 8 AM and finished at 5.30 PM, with an hour for lunch, 6 days a week. No wonder the Republic of Korea’s economy is the 10<sup>th</sup> biggest in the world!  My hands became sore using the heavy grinders and wielding the hammer to crack off the unwanted stone bit by bit. I wore gel filled fingerless mitts as used by road cyclists to help reduce the vibration and it did help.</p>

<p>However, it was also necessary to take regular breaks or change of task and stretching exercises to be able to keep going hour after hour. This was my first time working on granite and I have a new respect for those that choose to work in this material. My friend from the Check Republic insisted that the Korean granite was soft compared to the stone in his country. I will think twice before accepting and invitation to go to his country!</p>

<p>I carved a scale model 1;10 in Hebel block (autoclaved aerated concrete). This model proved invaluable in guiding my carving and showing the artisans and other sculptors at the site the project on which I was working. None of the sculptors was familiar with Hebel block and most thought the material resembled pumice stone.  Cast resin appeared to be most popular for making a model , one that would not break easily.</p>
